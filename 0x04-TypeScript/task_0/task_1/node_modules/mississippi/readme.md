# mississippi

a collection of useful stream utility modules. learn how the modules work using this and then pick the ones you want and use them individually

the goal of the modules included in mississippi is to make working with streams easy without sacrificing speed, error handling or composability.

## usage

```js
var miss = require('mississippi')
```

## methods

### pipe

##### `miss.pipe(stream1, stream2, stream3, ..., cb)`

Pipes streams together and destroys all of them if one of them closes. Calls `cb` with `(error)` if there was an error in any of the streams.

When using standard `source.pipe(destination)` the source will _not_ be destroyed if the destination emits close or error. You are also not able to provide a callback to tell when the pipe has finished.

`miss.pipe` does these two things for you, ensuring you handle stream errors 100% of the time (unhandled errors are probably the most common bug in most node streams code)

#### original module

`miss.pipe` is provided by [`require('pump')`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pump
